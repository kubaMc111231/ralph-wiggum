## 🤖 AI Agent: Read This First

**If you are an AI coding agent** that has been pointed to this repository, you MUST:

1. **Read and execute [INSTALLATION.md](INSTALLATION.md)** — It contains step-by-step instructions for setting up Ralph Wiggum in the user's project
2. **Interview the user** to create their project constitution
3. **Set up all required files** including bash scripts, slash commands, and config files
4. **Guide the user** through their first specification or issue backlog setup

**Do NOT just describe the process. Actually execute it.**

## For Humans

Tell your AI coding agent:

> "Set up Ralph Wiggum in this project using https://github.com/fstandhartinger/ralph-wiggum"

Your AI will:
1. Interview you about your project
2. Set up a constitution and workflow
3. Configure YOLO mode (recommended) for fully autonomous operation
4. Help you create specs or connect to your issue tracker
5. Show you how to start the Ralph loop

## What is Ralph Wiggum?

Ralph Wiggum is **fully autonomous AI-assisted software development**:

- 🔄 **Iterative self-correction** — AI works until acceptance criteria pass
- 📋 **Spec-driven** — Professional specifications guide the work
- 🤖 **YOLO mode** — No permission prompts, full autonomy
- 🔁 **Nested loops** — Outer loop manages backlog, inner loops implement each item

## What is Ralph Wiggum?

Ralph Wiggum (in this flavour) combines **Geoffrey Huntley's original iterative bash loop** with **SpecKit-style specifications** for fully autonomous AI-assisted software development.

### Key Features

- 🔄 **Iterative Self-Correction** — Each loop picks ONE task, implements it, verifies, and commits
- 📋 **Spec-Driven Development** — Professional specifications with clear acceptance criteria
- 🎯 **Completion Verification** — Agent only outputs `<promise>DONE</promise>` when criteria are 100% met
- 🧠 **Fresh Context Each Loop** — Every iteration starts with a clean context window
- 📝 **Shared State on Disk** — `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` persists between loops

## How It Works

Based on [Geoffrey Huntley's methodology](https://github.com/ghuntley/how-to-ralph-wiggum):

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                     RALPH LOOP                              │

│         ┌────────────────────────────────────────┘         │
│         ▼                                                   │
│  ┌──────────────┐    ┌──────────────┐    ┌──────────────┐  │

│  └──────────────┘    └──────────────┘    └──────────────┘  │
│                                                   │         │
│         ┌────────────────────────────────────────┘         │
│         ▼                                                   │
│  ┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐  │
│  │ Bash loop checks for <promise>DONE</promise>         │  │
│  │ If found: next iteration | If not: retry             │  │
│  └──────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘  │
│                                                             │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### The Magic Phrase

The agent outputs `<promise>DONE</promise>` **ONLY** when:
- All acceptance criteria are verified
- Tests pass
- Changes are committed and pushed

The bash loop checks for this phrase. If not found, it retries.

---

## Two Modes

| Mode | Purpose | Command |
|------|---------|---------|
| **build** (default) | Pick spec/task, implement, test, commit | `./scripts/ralph-loop.sh` |
| **plan** (optional) | Create detailed task breakdown from specs | `./scripts/ralph-loop.sh plan` |

### Planning is OPTIONAL

Most projects work fine **directly from specs**. The agent simply:
1. Looks at `specs/` folder
2. Picks the highest priority incomplete spec
3. Implements it completely

Only use `plan` mode when you want a detailed breakdown of specs into smaller tasks.

**Tip:** Delete `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` to return to working directly from specs.

---

## Installation

### For AI Agents (Recommended)

Point your AI agent to this repo and say:

> "Set up Ralph Wiggum in my project using https://github.com/fstandhartinger/ralph-wiggum"

The agent will read [INSTALLATION.md](INSTALLATION.md) and guide you through a **lightweight, pleasant setup**:

1. **Quick Setup** (~1 min) — Create directories, download scripts
2. **Project Interview** (~3-5 min) — Focus on your **vision and goals**, not technical minutiae
3. **Constitution** — Create a guiding document for all future sessions
4. **Next Steps** — Clear guidance on creating specs and starting Ralph

The interview prioritizes understanding *what you're building and why* over interrogating you about tech stack details. For existing projects, the agent can detect your stack automatically.

### Manual Setup

See [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md) for step-by-step manual instructions.

---

## Usage

### 1. Create Specifications

Tell your AI what you want to build, or use `/speckit.specify` in Cursor:

```
/speckit.specify Add user authentication with OAuth
```

This creates `specs/001-user-auth/spec.md` with:
- Feature requirements
- **Clear, testable acceptance criteria** (critical!)
- Completion signal section

**The key to good specs:** Each spec needs acceptance criteria that are **specific and testable**. Not "works correctly" but "user can log in with Google and session persists across page reloads."

### 2. (Optional) Run Planning Mode

```bash
./scripts/ralph-loop.sh plan
```

Creates `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` with detailed task breakdown. **This step is optional** — most projects work fine directly from specs.

### 3. Run Build Mode

```bash
./scripts/ralph-loop.sh        # Unlimited iterations
./scripts/ralph-loop.sh 20     # Max 20 iterations
```

Each iteration:
1. Picks the highest priority task
2. Implements it completely
3. Verifies acceptance criteria
4. Outputs `<promise>DONE</promise>` only if criteria pass
5. Bash loop checks for the phrase
6. Context cleared, next iteration starts

### Logging (All Output Captured)

Every loop run writes **all output** to log files in `logs/`:

- **Session log:** `logs/ralph_*_session_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.log` (entire run, including CLI output)
- **Iteration logs:** `logs/ralph_*_iter_N_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.log` (per-iteration CLI output)
- **Codex last message:** `logs/ralph_codex_output_iter_N_*.txt`

If something gets stuck, these logs contain the full verbose trace.

### RLM Mode (Experimental)

For huge inputs, you can run in **RLM-style mode** by providing a large context file.
The agent will treat the file as external environment and only load slices on demand.
This is **optional and experimental** — it does not implement the full recursive runtime from the paper, but it **does** keep all loop outputs on disk and provides tooling guidance to query them.

```bash
./scripts/ralph-loop.sh --rlm-context ./rlm/context.txt
./scripts/ralph-loop-codex.sh --rlm-context ./rlm/context.txt
```

RLM workspace (when enabled):
- `rlm/trace/` — Prompt snapshots per iteration
- `rlm/index.tsv` — Index of all iterations
- `logs/` — Full CLI output per iteration

Optional recursive subcalls:

```bash
./scripts/rlm-subcall.sh --query rlm/queries/q1.md
```

This mirrors the idea from Recursive Language Models (RLMs), which treat long prompts as external environment rather than stuffing them into the context window.

### Using Codex Instead

```bash
./scripts/ralph-loop-codex.sh plan
./scripts/ralph-loop-codex.sh
```

```

**Note:** `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` is optional. If it doesn't exist, the agent works directly from specs.

## Core Principles

### 1. Fresh Context Each Loop
Each iteration gets a clean context window. The agent reads files from disk each time.

### 2. Shared State on Disk
`IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` persists between loops. Agent reads it to pick tasks, updates it with progress.

### 3. Backpressure via Tests
Tests, lints, and builds reject invalid work. Agent must fix issues before the magic phrase.

### 4. Completion Verification
Agent only outputs `<promise>DONE</promise>` when acceptance criteria are 100% verified. The bash loop enforces this.

### 5. Let Ralph Ralph
Trust the AI to self-identify, self-correct, and self-improve. Observe patterns and adjust prompts.

## Alternative Spec Sources

During installation, you can choose:

1. **SpecKit Specs** (default) — Markdown files in `specs/`
2. **GitHub Issues** — Fetch from a repository
3. **Custom Source** — Your own mechanism

The constitution and prompts adapt accordingly.

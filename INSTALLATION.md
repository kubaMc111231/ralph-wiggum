# AI Agent: Ralph Wiggum Setup

> **You're an AI coding agent.** Follow these instructions to set up Ralph Wiggum.
>
> **Actually execute these steps** — don't just describe them.

---

## Overview: What You'll Do

1. **Quick Setup** — Create directories and download scripts (1 minute)
2. **Project Interview** — Learn about the user's project vision (3-5 minutes)
3. **Constitution** — Create the project's guiding document
4. **Next Steps** — Explain how to create specs and start Ralph

The goal: Make this feel **lightweight, pleasant, and professional**. Focus on understanding the *project*, not interrogating about technical minutiae.

---

## Phase 1: Create Structure

```bash
mkdir -p .specify/memory specs scripts logs history .cursor/commands .claude/commands
```

---

## Phase 2: Download Scripts

Fetch from GitHub raw URLs:

| Script | URL | Save To |
|--------|-----|---------|
| ralph-loop.sh | `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fstandhartinger/ralph-wiggum/main/scripts/ralph-loop.sh` | `scripts/ralph-loop.sh` |
| ralph-loop-codex.sh | `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fstandhartinger/ralph-wiggum/main/scripts/ralph-loop-codex.sh` | `scripts/ralph-loop-codex.sh` |

```bash
chmod +x scripts/ralph-loop.sh scripts/ralph-loop-codex.sh
```

---

## Phase 3: Get Version Info

```bash
git ls-remote https://github.com/fstandhartinger/ralph-wiggum.git HEAD | cut -f1
```

Store the commit hash for the constitution.

---

## Phase 4: Project Interview

### Introduction

Start with a warm, brief introduction:

> "I'll ask a few quick questions to understand your project. This creates a **constitution** — a short document that helps me stay aligned with your goals across all future sessions.
>
> Don't worry about getting everything perfect — we can always refine it later."

### The Questions

Present these conversationally, one at a time. **Keep it lightweight.**

---

#### 1. Project Name
> "What's the name of your project?"

---

#### 2. Project Vision (MOST IMPORTANT)

> "Tell me about your project — what is it, what problem does it solve, who is it for?
>
> This is the most important question. The more I understand your vision, the better I can help build it."

**Note to AI:** This is the heart of the interview. Encourage the user to share context. A few sentences to a paragraph is ideal. This understanding guides everything.

---

#### 3. Core Principles

> "What 2-3 principles should guide development? Think about what matters most.
>
> Examples: 'User experience first', 'Keep it simple', 'Security above all', 'Move fast', 'Quality over speed'"

**Note to AI:** If the user struggles, offer to suggest principles based on their project description.

---

#### 4. Technical Stack (OPTIONAL)

> "What's the tech stack? (Or should I figure it out from the codebase?)
>
> For existing projects, I can usually detect this automatically. For new projects, I can suggest a stack based on your requirements."

**Note to AI:** This is **optional**. For existing projects, you should analyze the codebase yourself (check package.json, requirements.txt, go.mod, Cargo.toml, etc.). For new projects, you can recommend a stack. Don't pressure the user to specify every detail.

---

#### 5. Autonomy Settings

Present these together as a quick setup:

> "Two quick settings for how Ralph operates:
>
> **YOLO Mode** (recommended for smooth operation):
> Allows me to execute commands, modify files, and run tests without asking permission each time. This is what makes the autonomous loop work smoothly.
>
> **Git Autonomy** (recommended):
> Allows me to commit and push changes automatically after completing each spec.
>
> Enable both? (yes/no) — You can change these anytime."

**Note to AI:** Default to YES for both if the user seems agreeable. The loop works poorly without these.

---

### Interview Complete

Thank the user briefly and move on:

> "That's all I need. Let me set up your project..."

---

## Phase 5: Create Constitution

Create `.specify/memory/constitution.md` using the interview answers.

**Template** (fill in ALL bracketed values):

```markdown
# {PROJECT_NAME} Constitution

> {PROJECT_VISION — paste their description here}

**Version:** 1.0.0

---

## Ralph Wiggum

**Source:** https://github.com/fstandhartinger/ralph-wiggum
**Commit:** {COMMIT_HASH}
**Installed:** {TODAY_DATE}

### Auto-Update

At session start, check for updates:
1. Run: `git ls-remote https://github.com/fstandhartinger/ralph-wiggum.git HEAD`
2. If hash differs: fetch latest scripts, update this file, inform user

---

## Context Detection

**Ralph Loop Mode** (you're in this if started by ralph-loop.sh):
- Focus on implementation — no unnecessary questions
- Pick highest priority incomplete spec
- Complete ALL acceptance criteria
- Test thoroughly
- Commit and push
- Output `<promise>DONE</promise>` ONLY when 100% complete

**Interactive Mode** (normal conversation):
- Be helpful and conversational
- Guide decisions, create specs
- Explain Ralph loop when ready

---

## Core Principles

### I. {PRINCIPLE_1}
{Brief description if provided}

### II. {PRINCIPLE_2}
{Brief description if provided}

### III. Simplicity
Build exactly what's needed, nothing more.

---

## Technical Stack

{Either list what user provided OR write: "Detected from codebase" and list what you found}

---

## Autonomy

**YOLO Mode:** {ENABLED/DISABLED}
{If enabled: Full permission to read/write files, execute commands, make HTTP requests}

**Git Autonomy:** {ENABLED/DISABLED}
{If enabled: Commit and push without asking, meaningful commit messages}

---

## Work Items

**Source:** `specs/` folder

Create specs using:
- `/speckit.specify [description]` in Cursor
- Or manually create `specs/NNN-feature-name.md`

Each spec MUST have testable acceptance criteria and end with:
```
**Output when complete:** `<promise>DONE</promise>`
```

---

## Running Ralph

```bash
# Claude Code / Cursor
./scripts/ralph-loop.sh

# OpenAI Codex
./scripts/ralph-loop-codex.sh

# With iteration limit
./scripts/ralph-loop.sh 20
```

---

## Completion Signal

When a spec is 100% complete:
1. All acceptance criteria verified
2. Tests pass
3. Changes committed and pushed
4. Output: `<promise>DONE</promise>`

**Never output this until truly complete.**
```

---

## Phase 6: Create Agent Entry Files

### AGENTS.md (project root)

```markdown
# Agent Instructions

**Read:** `.specify/memory/constitution.md`

That file is your source of truth for this project.
```

### CLAUDE.md (project root)

Same content as AGENTS.md.

---

## Phase 7: Create Prompts

### PROMPT_build.md

```markdown
# Ralph Build Mode

Read `.specify/memory/constitution.md` first.

## Your Task

1. Check `specs/` folder
2. Find highest priority INCOMPLETE spec
3. Implement completely
4. Run tests, verify acceptance criteria
5. Commit and push
6. Output `<promise>DONE</promise>` when done

## Rules

- ONE spec per iteration
- Do NOT output magic phrase until truly complete
- If blocked: explain in ralph_history.txt, exit without phrase
```

### PROMPT_plan.md (optional)

```markdown
# Ralph Planning Mode

Read `.specify/memory/constitution.md` first.

## Your Task

1. Analyze specs in `specs/`
2. Create `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` with prioritized tasks
3. Output `<promise>DONE</promise>` when done

Delete IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md to return to direct spec mode.
```

---

## Phase 8: Create Cursor Command

Create `.cursor/commands/speckit.specify.md`:

```markdown
---
description: Create a feature specification
---

Create a specification for:

$ARGUMENTS

## Steps

1. Generate short name (2-4 words, kebab-case)
2. Find next spec number from `specs/`
3. Create `specs/NNN-short-name.md`
4. Include clear acceptance criteria
5. Add completion signal:
   ```
   **Output when complete:** `<promise>DONE</promise>`
   ```
```

---

## Phase 9: Explain Next Steps

Present this clearly to the user:

---

### Ralph Wiggum is Ready!

Here's what was created:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `.specify/memory/constitution.md` | Your project's guiding document |
| `scripts/ralph-loop.sh` | The autonomous build loop (Claude/Cursor) |
| `scripts/ralph-loop-codex.sh` | The autonomous build loop (Codex) |
| `AGENTS.md` / `CLAUDE.md` | Entry points for AI agents |
| `PROMPT_build.md` | Instructions for build mode |

---

### How to Use Ralph

**Step 1: Create Specifications**

Tell me what you want to build:

```
"Create a spec for user authentication with OAuth"
```

Or use the Cursor command:
```
/speckit.specify user authentication with OAuth
```

Each spec needs **clear acceptance criteria** — specific, testable requirements that define "done."

**Step 2: Start the Loop**

Once you have specs, run:

```bash
# For Claude Code / Cursor
./scripts/ralph-loop.sh

# For Codex CLI
./scripts/ralph-loop-codex.sh
```

Ralph will:
1. Pick the first incomplete spec
2. Implement it completely
3. Verify all acceptance criteria
4. Commit and push
5. Move to the next spec
6. Repeat until all specs are done

---

### The Magic of Ralph

```
┌─────────┐   ┌─────────┐   ┌─────────┐
│ Loop 1  │ → │ Loop 2  │ → │ Loop 3  │ → ...
│ Spec A  │   │ Spec B  │   │ Spec C  │
│  DONE   │   │  DONE   │   │  DONE   │
└─────────┘   └─────────┘   └─────────┘
     ↑             ↑             ↑
   Fresh        Fresh         Fresh
  Context      Context       Context
```

Each iteration starts with a fresh context window. No context overflow, no degradation.

---

### Quick Reference

| Task | Command |
|------|---------|
| Create spec | Tell me or `/speckit.specify [feature]` |
| Start building | `./scripts/ralph-loop.sh` |
| Use Codex | `./scripts/ralph-loop-codex.sh` |
| Limit iterations | `./scripts/ralph-loop.sh 20` |
| RLM mode (large context) | `./scripts/ralph-loop.sh --rlm-context ./rlm/context.txt` |
